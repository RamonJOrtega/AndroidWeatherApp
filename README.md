Download this app to your Android phone to see the weather forecast!

This is a Java Andoid App built using a REST API at open-meteo.com.
The app runs asynchronous (non-blocking code) callback functions to get data.

Android has several libraries to help with asynchronous API code.
This application uses Volley.
Please note that google now recommends Cronet instead of Volley for API parsing.
Another alternative is Retrofit which is recommend as part of Jetpack (Googles 2019 release)

We install Volley Library
Parse a JSON data feed

Thank you freeCodeCamp.org for the tutorial used to create this highly-modified version of the app.
The biggest change is the removal of the depricated metaWeather API and the more-documented open-meteo API.
